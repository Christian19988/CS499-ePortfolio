# CS 499 Capstone – Christian Foster

Welcome to my CS 499 Capstone ePortfolio repository. This portfolio highlights my academic journey and the technical growth I’ve achieved through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It includes enhanced artifacts in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database development, along with documentation and reflections that demonstrate my readiness for real-world development work.

## Artifacts Overview

### 1. ABCU Course Planner (C++)  
**Course:** CS 300 – Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis and Design  
- Uses a Binary Search Tree to store and retrieve course data.
- Enhanced for recursive prerequisite validation, cleaner parsing, and improved memory handling.

### 2. GameService Singleton (Java)  
**Course:** CS 230 – Operating Platforms  
- Implements a Java singleton to manage game and team objects.
- Refactored for encapsulation, logic clarity, and best practices in object-oriented design.

### 3. Animal Shelter Data Handler (Python)  
**Course:** CS 340 – Client/Server Development  
- Connects to MongoDB to retrieve and display animal shelter data.
- Enhanced for modularity, secure connection handling, and integrated logging.
